Change the sign as necessary (from step 2).\nIf the integer is out of the 32-bit signed integer range [-2^31, 2^31 - 1], then clamp the integer so that it remains in the range. Specifically, integers less than -2^31 should be clamped to -2^31, and integers greater than 2^31 - 1 should be clamped to 2^31 - 1.\nReturn the integer as the final result.\n\nNote:\n\nOnly the space character ' ' is considered a whitespace character.\nDo not ignore any characters other than the leading whitespace or the rest of the string after the digits.",

        "description": "A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.\n\nFor example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].\n\nThe next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).\n\nFor example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].\nSimilarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].\nWhile the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.\n\nGiven an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.\nThe replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.",

        "difficulty": 3,
        "description": "Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.\nA code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:\n\nThe code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.\nA closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : <TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>. Among them, <TAG_NAME> is the start tag, and </TAG_NAME> is the end tag. The TAG_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG_NAME and TAG_CONTENT are valid.\nA valid TAG_NAME only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the TAG_NAME is invalid.\nA valid TAG_CONTENT may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched <, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG_NAME. Otherwise, the TAG_CONTENT is invalid.\nA start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.\nA < is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent >. And when you find a < or </, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG_NAME (not necessarily valid).\nThe cdata has the following format : <![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>. The range of CDATA_CONTENT is defined as the characters between <![CDATA[ and the first subsequent ]]>.\nCDATA_CONTENT may contain any characters. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse CDATA_CONTENT, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as regular characters.",
        "examples": [
            "Example 1:\nInput: code = \"<DIV>This is the first line <![CDATA[<div>]]></DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation: \nThe code is wrapped in a closed tag : <DIV> and </DIV>. \nThe TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata. \nAlthough CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.\nSo TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.",
            "Example 2:\nInput: code = \"<DIV>>>  ![cdata[]] <![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>>]</DIV>\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nWe first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.\nstart_tag -> \"<DIV>\"\nend_tag -> \"</DIV>\"\ntag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.\ntext1 -> \">>  ![cdata[]] \"\ncdata -> \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>\", where the CDATA_CONTENT is \"<div>]>\"\ntext2 -> \"]]>>]\"\nThe reason why start_tag is NOT \"<DIV>>>\" is because of the rule 6.\nThe reason why cdata is NOT \"<![CDATA[<div>]>]]>]]>\" is because of the rule 7.",
            "Example 3:\nInput: code = \"<A>  <B> </A>   </B>\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation: Unbalanced. If \"<A>\" is closed, then \"<B>\" must be unmatched, and vice versa."

The function whose ID is at the top of the stack is the current function being executed. Each time a function starts or ends, we write a log with the ID, whether it started or ended, and the timestamp.\nYou are given a list logs, where logs[i] represents the i^th log message formatted as a string \"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\". For example, \"0:start:3\" means a function call with function ID 0 started at the beginning of timestamp 3, and \"1:end:2\" means a function call with function ID 1 ended at the end of timestamp 2. Note that a function can be called multiple times, possibly recursively.\nA function's exclusive time is the sum of execution times for all function calls in the program. For example, if a function is called twice, one call executing for 2 time units and another call executing for 1 time unit, the exclusive time is 2 + 1 = 3.\nReturn the exclusive time of each function in an array, where the value at the i^th index represents the exclusive time for the function with ID i.",

To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n\nThe first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n\nFor example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\nSimilarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n\nIf a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\nThere will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n\nFor example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n\nAlso, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\nIt is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\nFinally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments.

The (1^st, 3^rd, 5^th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2^nd, 4^th, 6^th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. Note that the jumps are numbered, not the indices.\nYou may jump forward from index i to index j (with i < j) in the following way:\n\nDuring odd-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 1, 3, 5, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] <= arr[j] and arr[j] is the smallest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\nDuring even-numbered jumps (i.e., jumps 2, 4, 6, ...), you jump to the index j such that arr[i] >= arr[j] and arr[j] is the largest possible value. If there are multiple such indices j, you can only jump to the smallest such index j.\nIt may be the case that for some index i, there are no legal jumps.\n\nA starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index arr.length - 1) by jumping some number of times (possibly 0 or more than once).\nReturn the number of good starting indices.",

Comparing with treap and red-black tree which has the same function and performance, the code length of Skiplist can be comparatively short and the idea behind Skiplists is just simple linked lists.\nFor example, we have a Skiplist containing [30,40,50,60,70,90] and we want to add 80 and 45 into it. The Skiplist works this way:\n\nArtyom Kalinin [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons\nYou can see there are many layers in the Skiplist. Each layer is a sorted linked list. With the help of the top layers, add, erase and search can be faster than O(n). It can be proven that the average time complexity for each operation is O(log(n)) and space complexity is O(n).\nSee more about Skiplist: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list\nImplement the Skiplist class:\n\nSkiplist() Initializes the object of the skiplist.\nbool search(int target) Returns true if the integer target exists in the Skiplist or false otherwise.\nvoid add(int num) Inserts the value num into the SkipList.\nbool erase(int num) Removes the value num from the Skiplist and returns true. If num does not exist in the Skiplist, do nothing and return false. If there exist multiple num values, removing any one of them is fine.\n\nNote that duplicates may exist in the Skiplist, your code needs to handle this situation.",

Their subtotal is calculated as the sum of each amount[j] * (price of the j^th product).\nThe supermarket decided to have a sale. Every n^th customer paying for their groceries will be given a percentage discount. The discount amount is given by discount, where they will be given discount percent off their subtotal. More formally, if their subtotal is bill, then they would actually pay bill * ((100 - discount) / 100).\nImplement the Cashier class:\n\nCashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices) Initializes the object with n, the discount, and the products and their prices.\ndouble getBill(int[] product, int[] amount) Returns the final total of the bill with the discount applied (if any).

For example, if the i^th server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)^th server, then the (i+2)^th server, and so on.\n\nYou are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the i^th request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the i^th request (the time it takes to complete).

When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a set of mixed colors.\n\nFor example, if colors 2, 4, and 6 are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is {2,4,6}.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, you should only output the sum of the elements in the set rather than the full set.\nYou want to describe the painting with the minimum number of non-overlapping half-closed segments of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array painting where painting[j] = [leftj, rightj, mixj] describes a half-closed segment [leftj, rightj) with the mixed color sum of mixj.\n\nFor example, the painting created with segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]] can be described by painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]] because:\n\n\t\n[1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from both the first and second segments.\n[4,7) is colored {7} from only the second segment.\n\n\n\nReturn the 2D array painting describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are not painted).

It is interpreted as 0 minutes and 8 seconds.\nYou push 8 0 9 0. It is interpreted as 80 minutes and 90 seconds.\nYou push 8 1 3 0. It is interpreted as 81 minutes and 30 seconds.\n\nYou are given integers startAt, moveCost, pushCost, and targetSeconds. Initially, your finger is on the digit startAt. Moving the finger above any specific digit costs moveCost units of fatigue. Pushing the digit below the finger once costs pushCost units of fatigue.\nThere can be multiple ways to set the microwave to cook for targetSeconds seconds but you are interested in the way with the minimum cost.\nReturn the minimum cost to set targetSeconds seconds of cooking time.\nRemember that one minute consists of 60 seconds.",
